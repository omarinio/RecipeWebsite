# PLAN

* Index page with few featured recipes with most likes/saves
* All recipe page (perhaps add a filtering option)
* User profile page (profile pic, list of recipes)
* Individual recipe page (comments, picture, description, ability to live/save)

* Add deletion functionality for recipes
* Allow users to edit their already uploaded recipes
* Potentially add likes for comments (also maybe replies)
